            <h5>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h5>
            <hr>
            <h6>Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches!</h6>
            <p>At some point in the tenth century, four of the greatest witches and wizards that ever lived founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their names were Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. As The Sorting Hat told us, their reason for doing so was because they had the ‘selfsame yearning, to make the world’s best magic school’, and once they did, each created their own house to represent a personality and skill that they wanted to nurture. Gryffindor students embodied bravery and chivalry; Ravenclaw, intelligence and wit; Hufflepuff, loyalty and fair play; and Slytherin, the values of being sly and cunning..</p>
            <hr>
            <h6>It was built in Scotland, away from Muggle eyes</h6>
            <p>The tenth century was a dangerous time for witches and wizards, who were being persecuted by Muggles hostile to magic. Therefore, Hogwarts was built somewhere in the Scottish Highlands, and concealed with numerous charms and spells to make it impossible for Muggles to trespass. For instead of an enormous school, any passing Muggle would only see ruins and signs warning them of danger.</p>
            <h6>The castle itself was huge and complex</h6>
            <p>Hogwarts has a long history of ancient magic, and Albus Dumbledore admitted that not even he knew all of its secrets. Indeed, much about the design and construction of Hogwarts remains a mystery. Did the founders implement the Anti-Disapparition Jinx? Where did the Room of Requirement come from? Why did they build a school next to a dark and dangerous forest?</p>
            <h6>The founders were friends, but fell out over what Hogwarts should be</h6>
            <p>Much like the Marauders, or Harry, Hermione and Ron, the founders of Hogwarts were originally friends. Yet that changed once it became clear that certain founders had a very different idea of what they wanted Hogwarts to be. That founder, of course, was Salazar Slytherin, who distrusted Muggle-born wizards, and believed that only ‘pure-blood’ students should be allowed to attend Hogwarts. The other founders disagreed – especially Godric Gryffindor, who was, up until then, Slytherin’s greatest friend. Their argument – possibly, it’s suggested, a duel – resulted in Slytherin leaving the school behind.</p>
            <h6>How the Sorting Hat cameinto existence</h6>
            <p>Godric Gryffindor favoured the virtues of courage and heroism, and has been described by J.K. Rowling as ‘the best duellist of his time’ — both with a wand, and a sword. Thus his legacy lives on with the Sword of Gryffindor, the relic that Harry Potter used to destroy Horcruxes. But he also endures through another object. You see, when the founders became older, they were faced with a problem: how would they ensure that students were sorted into the right House after they were gone? For up until that point, that decision was made by them and them alone. The solution? Godric’s hat. The founders decided that the best course of action was for Godric to take off his hat so that all four of them could enchant it to sort students long after their deaths. And lo, the Sorting Hat was born.</p>
